//! Shared physical-contract support helpers.
//!
//! These helpers are split by contract family so rule costing code can import
//! a stable facade without mixing unrelated invariants:
//!
//! - `cardinality`: row-count and upper-bound transforms.
//! - `delivered`: delivered-property constructors and transforms.
//! - `window`: access-window physical/operator contracts.
//! - `pipeline`: stream/access pipeline assembly helpers.
