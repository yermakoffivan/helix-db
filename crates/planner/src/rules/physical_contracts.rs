//! Shared physical contract and costing helpers for optimizer rules.
//!
//! This facade keeps rule-facing physical contract functions stable while the
//! implementation is split by optimizer contract boundary. Access costing,
//! root-stream lowering contracts, pure pipeline contracts, individual stream
//! operators, and shared delivered-property helpers live in focused submodules.
