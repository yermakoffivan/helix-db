//! Stable crash-injection boundaries for durable index lifecycle transitions.
//!
//! The outbox recovery harness can request one named boundary through
//! `HELIX_INDEX_OUTBOX_FAILPOINT`. Setting
//! `HELIX_INDEX_OUTBOX_FAIL_ACTION=abort` terminates the process at that
//! boundary; otherwise the boundary returns an injected error. Tests use the
//! same typed enum through a one-shot in-process injector.
