//! Entry points for feature-gated production-codec coverage contracts.
//!
//! The `production-coverage` feature compiles this module into the database
//! crate so its children can reach private implementation boundaries through
//! their owning modules. Keeping the orchestration source under `tests/` lets
//! the coverage report exclude harness code while measuring the unchanged
//! production implementations and codecs that the contracts exercise.
//!
//! Integration tests should call the public runners in this module instead of
//! depending on private vector modules directly.
